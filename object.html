<h1>Do You Want To Build A Snowman?</h1>

<p>

by Kristen Bell 

Elsa
Do you wanna build a snowman?
Come on let's go and play
I never see you any more
Come out the door
It's like you've gone away!

</p>

<br>We used to be best buddies</br>
<br>And now we're not</br>
<br>I wish you would tell me why</br>
<br>Do you wanna build a snowman?</br>
<br>It doesn't have to be a snowman</br>
